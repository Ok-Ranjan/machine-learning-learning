## 📘 Purpose of This Folder

The goal of this section is to:
- Build a **strong foundation in supervised learning**
- Understand how models behave with real data
- Develop confidence in applying ML algorithms correctly

This folder is **learning-focused**, not production-oriented, and will continue to evolve as my understanding of Machine Learning improves.
