# Machine Learning Notebooks

This folder contains **Jupyter notebooks** focused on Machine Learning algorithms and workflows.

Each notebook is created for **learning and experimentation**, with explanations and step-by-step implementation.

## Structure

- `supervised/` – Supervised learning algorithms
- `unsupervised/` – Unsupervised learning (to be added)

📌 Purpose: Understand ML algorithms through hands-on implementation.
