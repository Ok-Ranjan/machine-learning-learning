This repository represents my **Machine Learning learning journey**, where I am building concepts **step by step — from basics to advanced** — through theory, implementation, and practice.

The focus is on **strong fundamentals, clarity of concepts, and hands-on coding**.

---

## Learning Goals

- Build a solid foundation in Machine Learning  
- Understand algorithms mathematically and intuitively  
- Implement models using Python and Scikit-learn  
- Progress from **basic → intermediate → advanced** ML topics  
- Prepare for internships, academics, and interviews
